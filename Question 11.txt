By the time I had figured out how to use this site again we had moved on to question 12 or a kahoot for some reason, I forgot which one, But it was definitel either of the two. So I guess just do this at home, Should be easy considering its a hardware question on HDD's and Optical Drives, Very easy and simple, I have no reason to still be typing but I am because im bored, Hello vro whos reading this, I hope you are doing well and have a splendid day.
